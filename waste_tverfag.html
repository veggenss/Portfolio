            <h2>Waste Management</h2>
            <p>Waste management is a critical component of environmental sustainability. In today’s world, we produce more waste than ever, much of which ends up in landfills or incinerators, contributing to pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. Waste prevention and efficient recycling are essential to reduce environmental impact and create a circular economy. Sorting waste, reducing single-use plastic, and adopting sustainable consumption habits are some of the key actions individuals and communities can take.

                Our focus on waste and the environment will involve looking into the different types of waste we produce, from household garbage to industrial waste, and how each type impacts the planet. We’ll explore initiatives like waste-to-energy processes, biogas production, and the ecological footprint of various waste disposal methods. Through gathering data and using interactive tools like quizzes and data visualizations, we aim to create awareness about waste reduction and explore innovative ways to minimize our environmental impact.</p>
            <h3>Sustainability Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recycling: Converts waste into new resources.</li>
                <li>Composting: Biodegradation of organic waste.</li>
                <li>Reduction: Minimizing waste at the source.</li>
