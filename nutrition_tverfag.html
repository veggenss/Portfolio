            <h2>Sustainability in nutrition</h2>
            <p>Sustainability in nutrition focuses on ensuring that our food systems meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A sustainable diet is one that supports human health while also being mindful of environmental impact. This involves choosing foods that are not only nutritious but also produced in ways that minimize environmental harm. For example, plant-based diets typically have a lower environmental footprint compared to meat-based diets, requiring less land, water, and energy. At the same time, food choices can impact biodiversity, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions.

                Looking at how what we eat affects the planet and how we can promote healthy, sustainable eating habits. This includes understanding the nutritional value of food as well as its impact on the environment. Through research and data collection, we aim to discover ways to balance personal health with the health of our planet, ensuring a sustainable future for all.</p>
