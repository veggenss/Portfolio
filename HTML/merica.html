        <div class="title">Welcome to Merica</div>

        <div class="page">
            <p>Well, howdy there, y’all! Welcome to the good ol’ U.S. of A., where the corn is tall, the BBQ is always smokin’, and we believe every problem can be solved with duct tape and a cold beer.<br><br>
            Here, we got more stars on our flag than a Hollywood movie premiere, and let’s be honest, who needs a passport when you got the wide open roads of America? You can drive for miles and miles, ‘cause what’s better than a never-ending highway to nowhere, am I right?<br><br>
            Y’all can enjoy our beautiful cities that have all the charm of a pothole and the traffic of a rush hour in a NASCAR race. And don’t get me started on our “national parks,” where you can experience nature while dodging tourists and trying not to get eaten by a bear! Who knew hiking could come with such a side of adrenaline?<br><br>
            Now, let’s talk food! We’ve got more fast food joints than you can shake a stick at, where else can you get a cheeseburger the size of your head, fries big enough to feed a family of four, and a drink that’s basically a bucket? It’s a wonder we haven’t invented a food pyramid shaped like a beer can yet!<br><br>
            And let’s not forget our exceptional education system! Who needs a degree when you’ve got a YouTube channel teaching you how to fix your truck? We’re raising a generation of DIY experts, one tutorial at a time!<br><br>
            So come on down and enjoy the land of the free, where the only thing bigger than our ambitions is our waistlines. We may not be perfect, but we sure know how to have a good time! Strap on your boots, grab your BBQ sauce, and let’s celebrate this great mess we call America!</p>
