        <!-- City 1 -->
        <h1>New York</h1>
        <img src="../Images/New York Image.jpg" alt="new york image">
        <p>New York, famous for its iconic city of New York, there's truly no place like it. Here, you can soak in the unique ambiance of bustling, noisy streets filled with the delightful scent of garbage on a summer's day. Enjoy giving a few dollars to the local “street performers” (who are just regular homeless folks) or take the plunge and purchase a cozy, closet-sized apartment for a mere $2,000,000. The possibilities for unforgettable experiences, and spending money, are endless!</p>
        <!-- City 2 -->
        <h1>California</h1>
        <img src="../Images/California.jpg" alt="california image">
        <p>California, where the sun shines brightly, and the traffic is always smooth, if by "smooth," you mean gridlocked for hours! You can soak in the beautiful beaches while trying to dodge the overpriced parking meters and the occasional seagull that thinks your fries are its personal buffet. Don't forget to visit Hollywood, where you can stand in front of a star and realize that you’ll probably never get one yourself, unless you count your star on Instagram!</p>
        <!-- City 3 -->
        <h1>Texas</h1>
        <img src="../Images/Texas.jpg" alt="texas image">
        <p>Texas, where everything is bigger, including the mosquitoes! Here, you can enjoy the wide-open spaces filled with endless ranches and an impressive variety of BBQ joints, where the food portions will make you question all your life choices. Be sure to stop by the Alamo, where you can ponder the significance of a historical site while standing in the sweltering heat and wishing you had brought a cooler full of water instead!</p>
        <!-- City 4 -->
        <h1>Florida</h1>
        <img src="../Images/Florida.webp" alt="florida image">
        <p>Florida, the land of sunshine, theme parks, and the delightful aroma of alligator swamps. You can visit Orlando's theme parks, where you’ll spend most of your day in long lines, sweating profusely while daydreaming about the overpriced funnel cake you plan to buy. And don’t forget the unique wildlife, who wouldn’t want to wrestle with an alligator or dodge a falling iguana during the winter months? Truly, a paradise!</p>
        <!-- City 5 -->
        <h1>Nevada</h1>
        <img src="../Images/nevada.jpg" alt="nevada image">
        <p>Nevada, home to Las Vegas, where you can lose your life savings faster than you can say “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!” Wander the glittering Strip, where neon lights and overpriced drinks can distract you from the fact that you’re surrounded by people who think it’s perfectly normal to wear pajamas in public. And let’s not forget about the charming desert landscapes, where the only thing less hospitable than the weather is the local wildlife!</p>
        <!-- City 6 -->
        <h1>Louisiana</h1>
        <img src="../Images/lousiana.jpg" alt="louisiana image">
        <p>Louisiana, where you can indulge in gumbo while navigating through the swampy bayous filled with delightful critters like mosquitoes and the occasional snake. Experience the vibrant nightlife in New Orleans, where the sound of jazz will be your background music as you try to dodge the drunks stumbling down Bourbon Street. And don’t worry about the humidity; it just adds to the authenticity of the “sticky” experience!</p>
        <!-- City 7 -->
        <h1>New Jersey</h1>
        <img src="../Images/new jersey.webp" alt="new jersey image">
        <p>New Jersey, where the air is thick with the scent of pizza and… well, other things! Take a scenic drive down the Turnpike, where you’ll be treated to a breathtaking view of gas stations and fast-food joints every five miles. And don’t forget to visit the beautiful beaches, if you can manage to find a spot that isn’t overcrowded with sunbathers or a family reunion. Truly, a state of endless charm!</p>
        <!-- City 8 -->
        <h1>Alaska</h1>
        <img src="../Images/alaska.jpg" alt="alaska image">
        <p>Alaska, where the sun sets for weeks at a time and you can experience the beauty of nature while freezing your toes off! Here, you can go dog sledding or ice fishing, all while wondering why you didn't bring a heated cabin with you. Marvel at the Northern Lights, which will surely remind you of how much you’re missing your cozy couch back home. It's a nature lover's paradise, if you can survive the cold!</p>
        <!-- City 9 -->
        <h1>Ohio</h1>
        <img src="../Images/ohio.jpg" alt="ohio image">
        <p>Ohio, the Buckeye State, where you can explore a rich tapestry of cornfields and a surprising number of amusement parks, because nothing screams excitement like a roller coaster built next to a corn silo! Enjoy the charming cities, where you can experience the thrill of “Where are we?” as you navigate your way through the endless suburbs. Don’t forget to try a Buckeye candy, which tastes like peanut butter but has all the excitement of a potato!</p>
        <!-- City 10 -->
        <h1>Michigan</h1>
        <img src="../Images/mitchigan.jpg" alt="michigan image">
        <p>Michigan, the Great Lakes State, where you can experience all four seasons in a single day, perfect for those who enjoy a surprise wardrobe change! Explore the beauty of the Great Lakes, where you can swim in crystal clear waters while dodging the occasional jellyfish or lost flip-flop. Don’t miss Detroit, the Motor City, where you can reminisce about the glory days of auto manufacturing as you drive past countless abandoned factories. </p>
